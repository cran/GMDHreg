Description: Regression using GMDH algorithms from Prof. Alexey G. Ivakhnenko.
    Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), or polynomial neural networks, is a family of inductive algorithms
    that performs gradually complicated polynomial models and selecting the best solution by an external criterion.
    In other words, inductive GMDH algorithms give possibility finding automatically interrelations in data, and
    selecting an optimal structure of model or network.
    The package includes GMDH Combinatorial, and GMDH MIA (Multilayered Iterative Algorithm) using PRESS (Predicted
    Residual Error Sum of Squares Statistic) criteria. It is calculated as the sums of squares of the prediction
    residuals for those observations.
